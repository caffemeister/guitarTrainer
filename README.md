Inside a technique, add any exercises you want and their BPM values. You can edit the BPM values as you like:

Contains a note location exercise where the app generates a number of random notes. Use that as you will:

Also contains a 4 random exercise picker that picks one random exercise from your Alternate, Economy, Sweep picking & Legato techniques each:

Basically, any blue colored text is a hotkey and will launch something for ease of access, i.e.

`'m' is a hotkey to launch a metronome in a browser`

`',' is a hotkey to launch 1 random exercise from Alternate, Economy, Sweep picking & Legato each`

`'gallop picking exercises' also launches an exercise video on YouTube`

Yellow colored text is used for buttons that launch a separate mini-app or minigame, i.e. a note locator. Something that's a bit more out of the ordinary compared to other things in the menu.

I'll probably add more to this app over time considering that I use it a lot.
